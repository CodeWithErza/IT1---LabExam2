# Number System Conversion Program

## Overview

This is a Number System Converter application built using Python and the Tkinter GUI library. The program allows users to convert numbers between different numeral systems (decimal, binary, octal, and hexadecimal) and perform basic arithmetic operations on the converted values. The interface is organized into three main sections: an input card for entering values and selecting bases, a results card displaying converted values, and a calculator card for performing calculations.

## Features

### Number Conversion Between Systems

The application supports conversion between:

- Decimal (Base 10)
- Binary (Base 2)
- Octal (Base 8)
- Hexadecimal (Base 16)
